					<h2>Stream Habitat Work Party</h2>
					<h3>Thursday, July 12, 2018</h3>
					<p>We were very excited to have a group from the MNRF's Stewardship Youth Rangers Program to do some work on Komoka Creek. This program gives groups of 16 or 17 year-olds an opportunity to spend 8 weeks working outdoors on natural resource management projects in their own community.<br>

					They worked on clearing a section of Komoka Creek upstream of the TRAA trout hatchery.  A major tree had fallen and a lot of the bank went with it. This created a blockage and was diverting the stream, increasing the likelihood of further bank side damage and erosion.
					We were also fairly certain that this was a barrier to migratory and resident fish passage. </p>

					<h2>Work Party - Hatchery Roof Repair</h2>
					<h3>Saturday, June 30, 2018</h3>
					<p>As most members already know, a large tree was blown down during high winds on May 2nd.

					Ironically, barely a week before this happened, we had already removed a couple of dead trees that had been identified as potential hazards to the hatchery.<br>

					At the time, we thought this tree wasn't a threat as it was well up the hill and well off to one side.
					It unfortunately glanced off of a couple of other trees as it fell, steering it directly on to the hatchery roof!<br>

					The resulting damage, shown in this picture after the tree was removed, will required the replacement of these metal roof panels and the plywood sheathing underneath them. In addition, a couple of the roof trusses needed to be repaired.</p>

					<h2>Rainbow Trout Release</h2>
					<h3>Saturday, June 23, 2013</h3>
					<p>This year we were pleased to welcome visitors from Chipewas of the Thames First Nation, to tour the trout hatchery and assist us with the release of more than 40,000 rainbow trout.

					Everyone was thrilled that the bald eagles with their young ones were keeping an eye on the proceedings at the release site.

					

					Otherwise, the hatchery will be idle for the summer except for routine maintenance.

					If you'd like to be part of the hatchery rotation and other TRAA activities just contact us.</p>

					<h2>Brook Trout Release</h2>
					<h3>Wednesday, May 17, 2017</h3>
					<p>The brook trout fingerlings went on the annual road trip throughout rural areas northeast of London to be released into several different cold water tributaries. These were brook trout eggs that we harvested with folks from the Upper Thames Conservation Authority (UTRCA) to be raised in the TRAA trout hatchery.<br>

					Thanks to everyone that has put in their time and effort to collect the brook trout eggs, monitor them in the hatchery and participate in the release.</p>

					<h2>Family Fishing Day - Fanshawe C.A.</h2>
					<h3>Saturday, July 9, 2016</h3>
					<p>This event has become another TRAA tradition. Members have been helping the Fanshawe Campers Association with the Family Fishing Day for many years now. The event wraps up at 1:00pm.If you can only come out for a couple of hours that's OK. That way if we have members showing up mid to late morning, that'll allow us to help out in shifts.

					If you have any questions please contact us.</p>

					<h2>Thames River Cleanup</h2>
					<h3>Saturday, May 7, 2016</h3>
					<p>TRAA members met with another group to do our yearly cleanup of the area around Komoka bridge (some may call it the Speedway bridge).

					While a good amount of trash was removed from the area, participants commented that there seemed to be significantly less to pick up than in previous years. Let's hope that trend continues!<br>

					It's always a great way to get some fresh air, light exercise and top up your commitment to "give back".

					Thanks go out to Jeremy Beaton for organizing the TRAA contingent..</p>

					<h2>TAngling Sports Barbeque</h2>
					<h3>Saturday, May 7, 2016</h3>
					<p>There was hotdogs, burgers and lots of fun going on at this informal get-together.

					Paul Noble put his barbequing skills to the test supplying a steady stream of hungry customers.

					Ryan Simard spent most of his time trying to sell tickets for the "Count the Bobbers Contest". Ryan was also the main guy in organizing and pulling this whole event together - nice work Ryan!<br>

					Your ticket gave you a chance at a $100 gift certificate courtesy of Angling Sports! As an additional bonus, you also got the equivalent of the tax taken off any purchase in the Angling Sports store!

					All the proceeds went to benefit the TRAA and our projects.</p>
